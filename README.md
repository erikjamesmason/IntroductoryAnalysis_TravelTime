## Summary:
Maybe you're like me in the sense where you interact, handle, manage, or report data - but you're not a data analyst (by trade, anyways). <br>Maybe you're aspiring or just enjoy engaging with data in a more meaningful way. This notebook is my work, which I aptly summarize as <b>Data Analysis for the Non-Analyst</b>

Though I always intend and attempt to improve myself and become more skilled, there's very little I know how to do compared with many other individuals. I intend to become better acquainted with data analysis, but until then, I hope this work helps inspire and instruct those who are maybe in a similar stage.

## Important Note:
This notebook uses data procured and distributed by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) through National Performance Management Research Dataset (NPMRDS) for State Department of Transportation use and reporting. This methodology is this author's own approach and experimentation.Â¶
<br>The data in this notebook is <b>not</b> accessible except by a Federally sponsored login. You <b>may</b> request the same dataset by emailing the author.

## Required Packages:
1. <a href='https://pandas.pydata.org/'> Pandas</a>
2. <a href='https://numpy.org/'> Numpy</a>
3. <a href='https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/'> Plotly Express</a>

### Optional Packages:
1. <a href='https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling'> Pandas Profiling </a>
2. <a href='https://datapane.com/'> Datapane </a>

## Sections Outline:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Wrangling/Cleaning
3. Visualization/Reporting

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
This section demonstrates simple ways to "peek" into your data and start making observations. Even if you are inexperienced or uneducated with math and statistics (like myself, more or less), there are simple things to note and explore that can lead to acute and incisive discoveries. This section also introduces Pandas Profiling, which was basically made for people like me (or us, if you're still reading this)

### 2. Data Wrangling/Cleaning
This section introduces some basic wrangling and cleaning that is prompted by some of the intricities of the dataset. This includes managing the data for efficiency and performance, handling issues like abnormal values or nulls, and formatting/parsing the data to be in the most useful and accessible form.

### 3. Visualization/Reporting
This section very succinctly displays some methods to visualize your data in a meaningful way, but in the most simplest design. Although more complex codes can generate more beautiful and insightful visualizations, the effort required to study and employ said more complex methods is often exasperating for someone who is simply needing to expand from simple Excel spreadsheets.
